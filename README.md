### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard, a software developer based in Toronto, ON.

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Integrated Engineering from the University of Western Ontario. 

My latest big project is [Learnify](https://learnify.ca), a workflow/study application for students that uses machine learning and natural language processing to help students manage their schedule and prepare for assessments.

I am an intermediate JavaScript full-stack developer (MERN). I have also added TypeScript, (machine learning with) Python, and Java to my skillset in 2020.

To connect with me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/richardantao), or email me [here](mailto:richardmantao@gmail.com).
