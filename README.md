### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated from the University of Western Ontario, with an undergraduate degree in Integrated Engineering. 

My latest big project is Learnify, a workflow/study application that uses machine learning and natural language processing to help students manage their schedule and prepare for assessments.

I am an intermediate JavaScript full-stack developer (MERN), and I have also added TypeScript, (machine learning with) Python, and Java to my skillset in 2020.
