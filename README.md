### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Richard, a software developer based in Georgetown, ON.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Integrated Engineering from the University of Western Ontario. 

My latest project is [Learnify](https://learnify.ca), a workflow/study application for students that uses machine learning and natural language processing to help students manage their schedule and prepare for assessments.

I am an intermediate full-stack JavaScript developer, and I am also comfortable with Python and Java.
